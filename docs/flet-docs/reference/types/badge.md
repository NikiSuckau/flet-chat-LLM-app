A Material Design "badge".

Badges are used to show notifications, counts, or status information about its control, typically an icon that is a part of a NavigationBar or a NavigationRail destination or a button's icon.

The information is shown as [`text`](/docs/reference/types/badge#text) on a badge's label. If the `text` is not provided, the badge is shown as a filled circle of [`small_size`](/docs/reference/types/badge#small_size) diameter.

If `text` is provided, the label is a StadiumBorder shaped badge with height equal to [`large_size`](#large_size).
